# Arcade Game Clone
## Arcade Game for FEND Project 3
This is an arcade game of the classic game of Frogger. Users need to cross the bricks and make it to the water.  

## How to Play the Game
[Play the game now](https://aysolis14.github.io/arcade-game/) or download the zip file and extract to your local computer and open the index.html file.
The goal of the game is to make it across the bricks to the water without getting hit by an enemy bug. 

To begin playing:
* Use arrow keys to move player 
* Player can move up, down, left and right
* Avoid colliding with an enemy bug
* When you reach the water, you have won!
 
## Game Logic
The user can only move the player up, down, left or right. They are confined within the boundaries of the game canvas. The bugs go at random speeds, so it is best to try and move as fast as you can to cross to the water. 


Once the user has made it to the water. A pop-up window modal will display saying they won the game. Users will be asked if they want to play again. If yes is clicked, the pop-up will close and reset the game. If no is clicked, the pop-up will close and users will see the game screen with their player at the water where they left off.
